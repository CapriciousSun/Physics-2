# Electric Field in Space
When there is a charge q in a point in space, all other points in space generated a force calculated as $$k\frac{q_1}{r^2}$$
Total electric field can be calculated in the same way as total electric force. Field produced by a negative charge points towards the charge, whereas positive charge points away from the charge, and this interaction can be visualized by a vector or collection of vectors.
