# Electric Field Lines
Electric field lines display the direction of the vector E, and the density of the field lines shows the intensity of E. Unless another opposite charge terminates the field line, they will extend to infinity. The vector of electric fields are tangent to the field lines. ![[Electric Field Lines 2.png]]
