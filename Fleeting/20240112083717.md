# Electric Field
Electric field is calculated by the formula $$\vec{E_1} = k\frac{q_1}{r_{12}^2}\hat{r}_{12}$$
The Coulomb Law formula can then be rewritten as $$\vec{F}_{1 on 2} = q_{2}\vec{E_1}$$
q1 would be the source of the electric field, and q2 is the target of it. The direction of the vector always points at q2 from q1.
The unit of electric field is N/C, or V/m.
