# Capacitance of a capacitor
The amount of charge within a capacitor is a function of the surface charge density of the positive end when the charge is evenly distributed along the surface. Capacitance is in turn a function of the area of the positive end and the distance between the positive and negative end. 
$$C = \frac{ε_0A}{d}\ \ \ ,\ \ \ C = \frac{Q}{V}$$
$$Q = \frac{ε_0A}{dV}$$
$$C' = \frac{ε_0A}{d'}$$
$$\oint\int$$
