# Capacitors in Parallel
Capacitors that are in parallel have the same potential difference between all capacitors. The potential between them is the same, so the amount of charge and capacitance between parallel capacitors can be calculated with this equivalency. Like capacitors in series, capacitors in parallel can be replaced by a single capacitor.
